        <p style="width: 60%; margin-bottom: 3rem">
          In order to create GUIDA, our solution to challenge 2, we utilized the
          core aspects of design thinking in our creation process to their
          fullest extent. Design thinking encompasses principles that outline
          the design process, aiming to innovate and create solutions for people
          that are both desirable, feasible, and viable. Below you will find how
          we worked with design thinking under these principles.

            <h3>Desirability</h3>
            <p style="width: 80%; font-size: 14px">
              In order to innovate, we first must understand who our users are.
              Therefore, we began our design process by formulating our target
              users which led us to the conclusion that the problem we faced was
              multifaceted. The stakeholders who formulated the original problem
              were marketing and management staff at IKEA, but in their view,
              the issue also affected in-store staff. We settled on designing
              for both of these groups, focusing on the staff using the product.
              <br /><br />
              One of the key aspects of TEK830 is the use of interviews as a way
              of information gathering and concretization of user needs.
              (Coaching Session Sep 12 - Design Thinking). Through interviews
              with in-store personnel at two IKEA locations we gathered their
              experiences using the available systems for presenting and selling
              products. We learned that there exists multiple systems with
              different purposes. However, they are used in parallel for the
              sole purpose of answering questions and selling. Furthermore, we
              found that the knowledge concerning product specifications and
              relevant logistics already exists in these parallel systems which
              led us to shift our focus to the unseen and unspoken problem.
              Therefore, we concluded that the problem IKEA management is
              experiencing is an issue at a higher level than the physical
              locations.
              <br /><br />
              In summary, we believe that a combination of the problems the
              in-store staff, marketing, and management were experiencing would
              accurately describe the problem statement provided and guide us to
              a solution that removes knowledge loss and provides easy access to
              information in an intuitive way. We had an idea that was desired
              by our users.

              align-items: center;
              flex-direction: column;

            <h3>Feasibility</h3>
            <p style="width: 80%; font-size: 14px">
              The technology required for our solution to function both exists
              and is readily available. We have planned out the technological
              components needed to create GUIDA and how we are going to obtain
              them as well as how we plan to use these tools.
              <br /><br />
              Implementing this into IKEA’s ecosystem is feasible since it
              requires little to no import of existing IKEA data. Instead, all
              that is needed is an account and the product is ready to be used.
              When designing GUIDA we didn’t want to create a solution that
              would replace existing IKEA systems, since that wouldn’t be
              realistic for IKEA to implement. This rather serves as a
              complement to existing IKEA systems, to synergize and make members
              of the IKEA team work more efficiently.

              color: whitesmoke;
            "

            <h3>Viability</h3>
            <p style="width: 80%; font-size: 14px">
              The viability of a product can be described as the possibility of
              profit and long term returns from a solution. (Lecture 4 - Design
              Thinking) We believe that there are profitable aspects of GUIDA.
              Firstly, the original problem statement from IKEA comes from a
              view of lacking efficiency in their value chain. Knowledge loss
              constitutes major costs in the form of wasted experiences and
              suboptimal operations. If the combined knowledge in a massive
              organization such as IKEA could be harvested and consolidated,
              there would surely be profit to be made.

              <br /><br />
              Considering that GUIDA is aimed to be a standalone product used in
              parallel with existing systems we believe that the long term
              returns and maintainability of such a product are highly viable.
              Integration with existing systems requires a higher level of
              system and business operations knowledge within IKEA. Integration
              also leads to a higher cost of development and imposes a risk of
              failure across systems. Therefore, when designing GUIDA we placed
              a large focus on creating it as a separate product minimizing
              these risks and keeping the knowledge required to develop and
              maintain GUIDA at a minimum. Long term this allows the life-cycle
              of GUIDA to be placed in the hands of many different teams over
              time.
